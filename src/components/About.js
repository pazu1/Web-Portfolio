                    Hi!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    I'm a student of Information Technology with a major in
                    programming. My main interest is developing software for the
                    web.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    This is my portfolio page for displaying some of my
                    projects.
                </p>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
